CODE:
class Solution
{
    //Function to check if two strings are rotations of each other or not.
    public static boolean areRotations(String s1, String s2 )
    {
        // Your code here
        return (s1.length() == s2.length()) && ((s1 + s1).indexOf(s2) != -1);        
    }
    
}

Input:
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
Output: 
1
Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is
forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated
version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by
left-rotating s1 by 5 units.
