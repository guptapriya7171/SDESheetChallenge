Strings in java is immutable because of a memory optimization using stringpool but we can make it mutable using StringBuffer class.
If our string is dynamic in nature and keeps on changing frequently than it is wiser to user StringBuffer.


CODE:

package String;

public class StringBufferDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
   
		StringBuffer str =  new StringBuffer("abc");
		str.setCharAt(0, 'h');
		System.out.println(str);
	}

}
