<h3>The repository includes all important question along with an easy and the optimized solution.</h3>

Note:
Data structures are referred to as a collection of data values and relationships between them, functions, and operations applicable to the data. so that, users can easily access and modify the data efficiently. Data structures help us to manage large amounts of data, such as huge databases. Efficient data structures are the fundamental basis for efficient algorithms

# Searching
Searching in data structure refers to the process of finding the required information from a collection of items stored as elements in the computer memory. 

## Searching Methods
Searching in the data structure can be done by applying searching algorithms to check for or extract an element from any form of stored data structure.

These algorithms are classified according to the type of search operation they perform, such as:

<h4> Sequential search </h4>
The list or array of elements is traversed sequentially while checking every component of the set.
<em><b>For example â€“ Linear Search.</b></em>

<h4> Interval Search </h4>
The interval search includes algorithms that are explicitly designed for searching in sorted data structures. In terms of efficiency, these algorithms are far better than linear search algorithms.
<em><b>Example- Logarithmic Search, Binary search.</b></em>
