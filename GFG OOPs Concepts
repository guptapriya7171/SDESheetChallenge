<b>OOPS</b>
Object oriented programming is super helpful for creating a larger and complex software. <br>
It has several entities that pass on data and make the required automation.
<h1>Following are the basic concepts of object oriented programming</h1>
Class
Object
Method
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Data Abstraction<br>


Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), is all about creating “objects”. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. <br>
These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. <br>
These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program.<br>
For example, a car can be an object. If we consider the car as an object then its properties would be – its color, its model, its price, its brand, etc. 
And its behavior/function would be acceleration, slowing down, gear change.<br>
