Question:
You have been given a queue that can store integers as the data. 
You are required to write a function that reverses the populated queue itself without using any other data structures.
Sample Input 1:
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 10
Note:
Here, 1 is at the front and 10 is at the rear of the queue.
Sample Output 1:
10 5 4 3 2 1

CODE:
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {

	public static void reverseQueue(Queue<Integer> input) {
		//Your code goes 
        if(input.size()<1){
            return;
        }
        int front = input.poll();
        reverseQueue(input);
        input.add(front);
	}

}
