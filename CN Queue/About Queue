A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served.
(i.e. First come first serve).
Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served,
that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the front of the queue(sometimes, head of the queue), 
similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the rear (or the tail) of the queue.

Characteristics of Queue:
Queue can handle multiple data.
We can access both ends.
They are fast and flexible. 

Queue Representation:
Like stacks, Queues can also be represented in an array: 
In this representation, the Queue is implemented using the array. 
Variables used in this case are -----
Queue: the name of the array storing queue elements.
Front: the index where the first element is stored in the array representing the queue.
Rear: the index where the last element is stored in an array representing the queue.
